# SWE_681
A client-server arithmetic guessing and solving game.
- Two Player game
- Both select a number and try and guess what arithmetic operation is happening against a specified random value for the game.
- If the outcome of the operation between the player's number and the random value is greater than the outcome of the opponent, you win the match. The losing player also loses their last number selection, limiting the moves they can make their next turn.
- If an opponent has only one selection left, they lose the game.
